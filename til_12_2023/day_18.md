# UFC: 
UFC is actually a private company run by famous Dana White

# SIM card:
SIM card or ATM card is actually a computer
It does use something call GSM protocol to do authentication on mobile device
U can actually clone a SIM card if u can extract the private key from it
Above method in theoratical works almost case but since > 2G SIM card the key is too large to predict now
So no more exploits this way for now on

# DVT:
There is something call Distributed Validator Technology
I dont know about this much
Ex:
U join a network (blockchain)
U have to own a minium amount of token(coin) to be considered as a valid validator
So when all or minium number of validators come to agreement(consensus mechanism) the new contract(transaction) will be good to go
