# Wayland:
Today i swicthed from X11 to Wayland on KDE
Ibus on Wayland is suck
Use Fcitx5 instead, work like a charm

Wayland smooth as fuck
But Edge on wayland is suck

Wayland still suck with KDE
Have to revert to X11
Just kidding! :))

Btw, wayland keep freezing panel frequently, so have to restart panel 

# VScode:
I fixed some issue with icon by changing to font:
`'DejaVuSansM Nerd Font Mono'`

# Hello
