# Wayland:
Today i decided to back to X11
No more Wayland on my Tuf Dash F15 2022 i7, RTX 3060
Wayland got issue with Intel and Nvidia, should use AMD then
Cant play game on Steam like l4d2, which is perfectly playable on x11
Xclip is unusable as well
This [thread](https://gist.github.com/probonopd/9feb7c20257af5dd915e3a9f2d1f2277) is covered most of things
Although wayland support so smooth and fast navigation between desktop but it not worth the shot

# Dbus:
Dbus is like a event listener
It will listen/observe for shortcut to be hit then excute script that was mapped
U can run `dbus-monitor` to show what is happening then

# Kwin scripts:
I found some awesome ones

# Konsave
Apply new theme will overwrite all existing settings include panel at desktop
So keep in mind to backup frequently
